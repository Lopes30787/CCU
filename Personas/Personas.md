Monica, Age 21, Architecture student, lives in a shared student house. 

Monica works part-time at a local supermarket to cover living expenses and tracks expenses through “Wallet by BudgetBakers”, a widely used budget tracker. 

Monica is currently saving up to Interrail, however it is difficult to know the living expenses of each city. 

Monica would like to have a functionality that would allow her to sum up the average expenses of each city throughout the Interrail, to have a concrete goal to which to save up.

Renato, Age 19, Medical Student, lives alone. Receives allowance from his parents every month. Doesn’t have any current saving goal. Renato would like an app to help him on his monthly spending, mainly on groceries and nightlife. Isn’t interested in going abroad because he doesn’t like to be far from family.


<h3>Lars (Has gone abroad)</h3>

![](/Personas/Lars.jpg)

Lars, Age 23, Business Student, lives with family and receives allowance from his parents. 

He did an exchange program in Portugal for 6 months and he had a great time there. He admits however that he has some regrets about the way he managed his money while he was there. He ended up spending more than he would’ve liked in shopping and nightlife. 

Lars is saving up money for traveling more and to have an emergency fund. In order to do so, he defines detailed goals he wants to achieve and uses tools like excel. However, he’s not actively doing anything to achieve this goal (just saving up when he can).  

Lars (about what he considers important to know before moving): “costs of transportation/culture/etc might be significantly different from where you live. You will always spend more money than you're planning to”
