-----------
Task 1
-----------
Task: 
You went to telepizza to have lunch and spent 7€. Add this expense in your application
 
Feedback: 
one user went to the Expenses tab first

Changes made: 
we made the homescreen button to add an expense more obvious
we also changed the tab name from "expenses" to "history" since this name makes more sense

-----------
Task 2
-----------
Task: 
Check how much money can you still spend on food this week.

Feedback: 
users tried to click on the "available" rectangle in the homescreen
users mistook spent money with available money on the "Limits" screen

Changes made: 
"available" rectangle in the homescreen now redirects to the "Limits" screen
added word "spent" before the value presented in the "Limits" screen

-----------
Task 3
-----------
Task: 
In the last 4 months, in which one did you spent the most money?

Feedback: 
one user tried to filter the expenses in the "Expenses" screen instead of using the "Statistics" screen

Changes made: 
we concluded this error wasn't relevant since you can also obtain the correct answer using this method

-----------
Task 4
-----------
Task: 
Which was the most costly category that month?

Feedback: 
users had no problems completing this taks

-----------
Task 5
-----------
Task:
Check your expenses in entertainment since the first day of classes (18/09/2022).

Feedback: 
users tried to use the "Statistics" and "Categories" screens

if you click in a category in the categories menu, now it redirects you to a filtered expense history
we concluded that the user's errors stemmed from the way the question was formulated
