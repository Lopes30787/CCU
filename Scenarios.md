<h3>Descriptive</h3>

Monica is at home when she decides to open the app she regularly uses to track her budget (Wallet by BudgetMakers) to check her progress towards her travel goal (Interrail). She has set a goal to what she thinks is enough, but not knowing precisely makes her anxious. She researches on the internet about the topic for example, the average restaurant meal. What does this mean however? Monica won´t eat out everyday. Would there be an app that uses her regular spending habits and average travel location costs to infer the goal value?

Renato is at a party with his friends on a friday night when he notices that he is running low on money and he has to buy his groceries at least once until he receives his next month allowance. Feeling upset and responsible for bad management of his money, he wonders if there was a mobile app that could help him with his budget management that would alert him of his spendings, in order to not feel choked with the amount of money he still has.

Lars just came back from his semester abroad in Portugal. He loved this experience so much, he wants to travel again soon. Unfortunately however, he spent a little too much money during his time in Portugal so now he has to start budgeting and be more careful about his spendings if he wants to travel again. In order to do so, he defines a goal and creates an excel sheet where he tracks the money he spends and calculates his weekly/monthly balances. He hopes this will bring him closer to his goal. He wonders if there’s an app  that would make this process easier and more automated.
